# SEGESCode
This is the base code of the SEGES Proyect.

The SEGES project is based on a control system for a nursery assisted by home automation, where soil, nutrient, air conditioning, lighting and irrigation tasks are automated; allowing its operation practically independently of the environment where it is installed. It uses an Arduino programmable controller with attached modules to sense environmental parameters and activate actuators that allow its modification, searching for the optimum point for the cultivation of vegetables and vegetables in a 100% controlled environment.
