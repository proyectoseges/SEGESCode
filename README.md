# SEGESCode
This is the base code of the SEGES Proyect.

The SEGES project is a control system that allows a greenhouse to be assisted by home automation.  Nutrient suministration, air conditioning and lighting tasks are automated. This makes its functioning to be practically independent of the environment in which it is installed. It uses an Arduino programmable controller with attached modules to sense environmental parameters and activate actuators that allow its modification, searching for the optimum point for vegetables cultivation in a 100% controlled environment.
